# splintah's system configuration

My system configuration is almost fully written in [Nix](https://nixos.org).
I use [home-manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) to build the user configuration, and NixOS to build the system configuration.
(The system configuration is not (yet) contained in this repo, since it is a mess which needs a lot of cleaning up.)
